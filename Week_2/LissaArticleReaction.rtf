In the article, \'93Five Important Considerations for Wireframing\'94, Lissa Aguilar goes over what should be done or acknowledged before and during the process of wireframing. From asking questions on what the wireframe is for, doing prototype sketches, getting appropriate advice on the wireframe\'92s parameters, acquiring the right tools and making sure that the wireframe caters to the audience. All of this focuses on creating a wireframe that can be worked with and understood, and this article is a great reminder for certain tasks that can lead to a great wireframe.}
